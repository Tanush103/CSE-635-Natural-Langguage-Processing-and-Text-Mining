The task1 checkpoint file implements various NLP state of the art models like BERT, Bertweet, RoBERTa with multiple configurations.
The code in the file is self explanatory and comments were added at relevant cells.
General structure of code is: data reading -> loading -> data pre-processing (depends on us) -> NLP model transformer -> data encoding -> creating data loader -> NLP model class -> pre trained model import -> freezing the layer -> model training -> evaluation.
